# Algorithm and Implement of Speech-based Speaker Recognition Model

### Research Purpose
Recently, the penetration rate of IoT devices is increasing. It is very important to authenticate as a user because it is a device shared by multiple users.
Although various biometric technologies have developed, it is characterized by the ability to lower order while certifying that it is user, especially if it uses voice.

In other words, as long as users say keywords they registered, by performing assigned commands at the same time as having exclusive access to private access to information and aim an automation.
Therefore, the goal was to create a model that can fulfill both speaker and voice recognition simultaneously. 

### About Us
We are senior students of Hanyang University, Department of Mathematics. We formed our team in Math Capstone PBL Course. We are trying to implement a Speaker and Speech Recognition model using Deep Learning. We will keep writing what we have studied and implemented code here during this semester.
