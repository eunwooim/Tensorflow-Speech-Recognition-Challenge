# Algorithm and Development of Speech-based Speaker Recognition Model
### About Us
We are senior students of Hanyang University, Department of Mathematics. We formed our team in Math Capstone PBL Course. We are trying to implement a Speaker and Speech Recognition model using Deep Learning. We will keep writing what we have studied and implemented code here during this semester.
