# Algorithm and Development of Speech-based Speaker Recognition Model
### About Us
We are senior students of Hanyang University, Department of Mathematics. We formed our team in Math Capstone PBL Course. We are trying to implement a Speaker and Speech Recognition model using Deep Learning. We will keep writing what we have studied and implemented code here during this semester.
### About Sound Wave
Sound is produced by the vibration of an object. This vibrations determine oscillation of air molecules which basically creates an alternation of air pressure. This high pressure alternated with low pressure causes a wave. And this wave can be represented using Wave Form. Take a look at the following example.
![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68213812/113736297-ef606700-9737-11eb-82f0-5f49ff90b935.png)
The wave form can be represented using an amplitude and a time. We define period(or wavelength) as a distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase on the wave, and amplitude as a distance of a peak point from zero.
